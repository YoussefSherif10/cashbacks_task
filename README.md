# Feature Expansions and Improvements

## Dockerization of the Application

We have expanded the project to include a complete Docker setup, making it easier to develop, test, and deploy the application consistently across different environments. This feature includes:

- A `Dockerfile` for building the application image
- A `docker-compose.yml` file for orchestrating the application services
- A `start.sh` script for automating database setup and application startup

### Key Benefits:

1. **Consistent Development Environment**: Ensures all developers work with the same setup, regardless of their local machine configuration.

2. **Easy Setup**: New team members can get the application running with just a few commands, without needing to install dependencies manually.

3. **Automated Database Management**: The start script automatically sets up, migrates, and seeds the development and test databases.

4. **Integrated Services**: Includes PostgreSQL and Redis services, configured and ready to use.

5. **Production-like Environment**: The dockerized setup closely mimics the production environment, reducing "it works on my machine" issues.

### Usage:

To use the dockerized setup:

1. Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed on your machine.
2. Clone the repository.
3. Run `docker-compose build` to build the Docker images.
4. Run `docker-compose up` to start the application.

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

This dockerization feature significantly improves the development workflow and sets the stage for easier deployment and scaling in the future.
